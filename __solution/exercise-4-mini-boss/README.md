# The Events Workshop

## Exercise 4 - Is This All a Game to You?!

Building on the exercises done so far, write a program that

- on load, there is only a 'Start' button
- clicking on the start button
    - deletes the button
    - a random number of buttons appear on the screen.
- These buttons need to all be clicked within a given amount of time.

If the user is successful, reward them! They've won the game!!

### Note.

- Once the user clicks all of the buttons, the game ends.
- Once the game ends, the buttons no longer change change color (remove the event listeners).

### B-E-A-U-TIFUL

Don't forget to take some time to make it pretty.
