### Events and DOM Nodes

All DOM nodes have methods we can use to _notify_ us of an event.

- [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
- [`removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)

```js
// Example
```

---

### [Event Object](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_event.asp)

Event handler functions are passed an argument, when events are triggered.

```js
window.addEventListener(function (event) {
  console.log(event);
});
```

---

### Default Actions

Some events have _default_ actions associated to them.

- click a link
- press down arrow
- click the submit button in a form

In most cases handlers are called _before_ the default action takes place.

---

You can prevent the _default_ action from happening by calling `event.preventDefault();` in the eventListener function.

---

### target

- The `target` property refers to the node where they originated. (example)
- With an `input`, use `event.target.value` to read what was entered into an `input`.

---

### Propagation

Handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive events that happen in the children.

```html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#"><img scr="..." /></a>
    </li>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

---

```html
<p>
  A paragraph with a
  <button id="the-btn">
    button</button
  >.
</p>
```

```js
let para = document.querySelector('p');
let button = document.querySelector('button');

para.addEventListener('mousedown', () => {
  console.log('Handler for paragraph.');
});

button.addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => {
  console.log('Handler for button.');

  if (event.button == 2) {
    event.stopPropagation();
  }
});
```

# Balloon Exercise

> **Balloon**
> Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, 🎈). When you press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.
