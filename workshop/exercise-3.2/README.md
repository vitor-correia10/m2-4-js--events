## Exercise 3.2 - Red to Green to Red again.

You can copy the `HTML` file over, but I strongly recommend redoing the JS from scratch without looking at your previous answer as mush as possible.

Building on exercise 3.1, write a program that places 20 buttons in the page, but this time clicking on a green button should turn it back to red.
