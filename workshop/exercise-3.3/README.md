## Exercise 3.3 - Buttons, Here, There, Everywhere!

You can copy the `HTML` file over, but I strongly recommend redoing the JS from scratch without looking at your previous answer as mush as possible.

Building on exercise 3.1 and 3.2, write a program that places 20 buttons in the page that toggle from red to green but this time they are located in random positions on the screen.
